For execting test you have to run ./tests, mandatory argument is the type of operation to perform: r,w, rw. If w operation is specified, please specify a path, a blocksize(in kB). The order is operation->path->blockSize. If the database already exists blockSize option will be ignored.
To delete filesystem please simply remove ./test directory.

Examples:

./tests r
./tests rw /home/myFile 64
